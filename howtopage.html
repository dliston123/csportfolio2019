    <h1 style="border: 2px solid white">What to do and How to do it</h1>
    <h2 style="border: 2px solid white">What I created</h2>
    <h4>I made clovers. One clover was the logo of a three leaf clover and the other was a regular four leaf clover</h4>
    <h4>I then made the logo black and made the four leaf clover green </h4>

    <h2 style="border: 2px solid white">Does the Project Work Overall?</h2>
    <h4>The project does work very well overall. I am very happy I was able to make my own design and make it work with the help of my classmates and my teacher.</h4>

    <h2 style="border: 2px solid white">Specifics of the Code and How they Work</h2>
    <h4>Some specifics of the code are the draw "function" code. The "draw function" code allows you to input the code for your javascript drawing</h4>

    <h4>Some others are the ellpise and triangle code that enables you to draw circles amd triangles</h4>

    <h4>Others are the if statements which enable you to determine what pops up on the x or y axis</h4>

    <h2 style="border: 2px solid white">Choices I made</h2>
    <h4>Some choices I made were making the leaves for the logo black and the leaves on the four leaf clover green. Also, I made the choice of making the stems triangular instead of rectangular because it looks better with a triangle stem.</h4>
    <h3>Three Leaf</h3>

    <h3>Four Leaf</h3>

    <h2 style="border: 2px solid white">How This Changed my Connection with Art and Programming</h2>
    <h4>This changed my connection with art and programming because I got to make what I wanted to make without any repercussions. I got to make</h4>
    <h3 style="border: 2px solid white">This:<img src="images/fourleafclover.png"/></h3>
    <h3 style="border: 2px solid white">And this: <img src="images/threeleaf.png"></h3>
    
    <h2 style="border: 2px solid white">What I Would Change if I had More Time</h2>
    <h4>I would probably have made a loop on the clovers where the clovers change from green to black and vice versa</h4>

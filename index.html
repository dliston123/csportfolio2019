    <p> Hi my name is Daniel Liston. I am in tenth grade at Summit Shasta high school. I do many things. Some that most people do and some that not a lot of people do really. In the sections down below I will explain most of the many sports I do, my general likes, my personal life and my hobbies in more detail.</p>
    
    <h2 style="border: 2px solid white;"> Sports I do </h2>

    <p>One of the sports I do is road biking. This is a type of biking not a lot of people do. I think that it is because in this sport you have to wear tight bike clothes and for especially the guys, it makes them feel uncomfortable because they aren't used that type of clothing</p>

    <p> Another sport I do is BMX biking. This is a very popular type of biking. There is a very large production of BMX bikes. There are big events that go on for BMX riding. There are also many brands that make BMX bikes. </p>

    <p>Another sport I do and am getting into is mountain biking. My dad has always loved mountain, but he had to stop because my brother and I were born and he couldn't risk an injury while my brother and I were little. But if he does do mountain biking he would do it with us on a fire road then a few challenging switchbacks.</p>

    <p>The next sport I will be talking about that I do is swimming. I have swimming pretty much my whole life. I like it because I get to be in the water and I get to exercise. I also like it because it helps me with my breathing because I kind of have asthma, and swimming requires you to sometimes hold your breath. So I'm glad that my parents got me into swimming.</p>

    <p>Finally, the last of the many sports I do this list is rollerbladng. I like rollerblading because I can do roller hockey and practice skiing turns. My dad got me into rollerblading. And he taught me how to practice skiing turns and how to play rollerhockey.</p>

    <p>One of my general likes is playing fortnite or watching fortnite livestreams on youtube. I like fornite because it is a free for all, it is a shooting game, and it doesn't look so violent. I also like it because of the celebration dances.</p>

    <p> Another one of my general likes is designer brands. I like them because the clothing they produce is very stylish. I also like it because of the names they have; they are very catchy.  </p>

    <p>I also like listening to rap. I like it because then I can zone out from the world around me.</p>
